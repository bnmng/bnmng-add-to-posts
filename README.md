bnmng Add to Posts is a plugin to add text to the beginning and end of a post's content while it displayed in singular view.

== Description ==

bnmng-add-to-posts is a WordPress plugin for adding text, including HTML and shortcodes, to the beginning and end of a post's content.  It does not alter the content of the post that is saved in the database.

The posts selected for adding text can be narrowed by type (post, page, etc) by category, and/or by author.  Multiple instances can be created, so certain text can be added to posts fitting one set of criteria and different text can be added to posts fitting a different profile.

HTML and shortcodes may be used.  Tags that are opened in the beginning may be closed at the end, and end of post content is added in reverse order for proper nesting.

=== Use Cases ===

You've installed Twin Picture's [Print-O-Matic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/print-o-matic/) and want to include their [print-me] shortcode on every post.

You want to include a blurb about your authors on each post that the author writes

You want to add formatting to certain categories

1. Upload the `bnmng-add-to-posts` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Find the `bnmng Add to Posts` menu item under `settings`
